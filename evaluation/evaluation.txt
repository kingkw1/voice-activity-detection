For evaluation with STRONG data, we will build a labeled test dataset. This will involve using a file that has the
mic'ed audio correctly separated from the replay audio. This will be used with our simpler voice detection algorithm to
generate labels. We will then create the test audio by adding the mic audio to the game replay audio.

TODO: Consider treating subjects 1 and 2 differently, as they record the audio differently for videos.
